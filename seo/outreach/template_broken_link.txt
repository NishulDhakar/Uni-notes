Subject: Broken link on your {Page Name} page

Hi {Name},

I was browsing your {Page Name} page today and noticed a broken link.

The link to "{Old Site Name}" seems to be dead/404.

If you're looking for a replacement, we have an updated and active library of similar notes at RGPVNotes.in. It might be a good fix for your readers.

Hope that helps!

Best,
