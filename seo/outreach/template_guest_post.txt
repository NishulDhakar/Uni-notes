Subject: Article idea for {Site Name}: "How to ace RGPV exams"

Hi {Name},

I've been following {Site Name} for a while and loved your recent post on {Topic}.

I'm writing from RGPVNotes.in, a community resource for engineering students. We have some unique data on the most difficult subjects for RGPV students based on download patterns.

I'd love to write a guest post for your blog titled "5 Data-Backed Tips to Crack RGPV Exams" or "The Most Common Mistakes RGPV Students Make".

It would be 100% unique, high-quality content relevant to your audience.

Let me know if you'd be interested?

Best,
